# Week 1 Challenge

## Project Description
For the first week's challenge we were asked to work on starter code (Marketing Agency Website) and modify it. The purpose of the modification was to make the website more accesible. 

We were asked to:
* use semantic HTML elements, 
* make sure HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, 
* add alt attributrs to images and icons,
* heading attributes fall in sequential order,
* title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

## My Approach
I approached this project by learning more about semantic elements from w3schools website. I substituted all the div elements with appropriate semantic elements like: header, nav, main, aside section, footer and more. Next I added alt attributes to all img elements.

While I was changing the index.html file I needed to make sure my new semantic elements have appropriate styling applied. Every time I changed a div (or other element) I also updated the style.css file, so all new elements are properly styles.

With the style.css file I also tried to simplify as it had a lot of code repetition going on. I merged the classes that affected the benefits column and merged the classes that will simplify the services sections. I used comments to hilight my updates.
## Technologies
This project was made using HTML and CSS only.
